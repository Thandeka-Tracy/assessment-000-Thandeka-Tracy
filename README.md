# Inspiration for this Assessment
I’m giving you the same assessment you recently had at school, but this time, it’s not just about getting it right or wrong. The goal is to see if you’ve reviewed your mistakes, learned from them, and reinforced your understanding of the concepts. This process of repetition is key—it strengthens your ability to apply knowledge more confidently and accurately.

When you revisit something you've learned, you solidify your understanding and fill in the gaps you might have missed. Think of it like building muscle—the more you practice, the stronger your skills become.

# Assessment 000 - Python Fundamentals & Problem Solving

- Modify `fundamentals.py` to solve the problem as stated in [TODO ref to content's problem description].
- The skeleton code needs to be fixed before the tests run.
- You can test technical correctness by running the unit tests shown below.
- DO NOT MODIFY TESTS IN THIS FILE `test_fundamentals.py`.

## To Test

- To run all the unittests on your terminal: `python3 -m unittest tests/test_fundamentals.py`
- To run a specific step's unittest on your terminal, e.g step 1: `python3 -m unittest tests.test_functions.TestFunctions.test_get_date_of_birth`
- Note: at the minimum, these (unedited) tests must succeed before you may submit the solution for review.
